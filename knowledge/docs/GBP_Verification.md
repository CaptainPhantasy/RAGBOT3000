# 🛑 TRAP-DOORS (Instant Failure Risks)

> **CRITICAL WARNING**: "Do not edit your business name, address, or category on your Business Profile [while waiting for a postcard]. If you do, the code we sent you won't work."

- **IVR Systems**: Phone verification fails if the line has an interactive voice response system; it must be a direct line.
- **Code Expiry**: Codes are dead after 30 days.
- **Re-Verification Trigger**: Changing core business details (Address, Name) *after* verification can trigger a re-verification requirement.
- **Video Upload Failures**: Videos over 2 minutes or 75MB often fail at "99% upload". Keep it short.
