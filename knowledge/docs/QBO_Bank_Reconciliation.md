## Why This Matters (Accounting Context)
Reconciliation ensures your QuickBooks records match the bank's actual records. This critical control helps detect:
- Missing transactions
- Duplicate entries
- Bank errors
- Unauthorized transactions

It's the foundation of accurate financial reporting and prevents fraud.

## Common Error States / Pitfalls

### Beginning balance doesn't match
- **What you see:** Beginning balance in QuickBooks differs from bank statement
- **Diagnosis:** Check for previously reconciled transactions that were changed or deleted
- **Fix:** Run a Reconciliation Discrepancy Report to identify changed transactions

### Difference won't zero out
- **What you see:** After matching all transactions, difference is not zero
- **Diagnosis:** Look for:
  - Bank fees or interest not entered
  - Transposed numbers (e.g., $45.00 vs $54.00)
  - Duplicate entries
- **Fix:** Enter missing transactions or correct errors, then continue reconciliation

### Duplicate bank feed transactions
- **What you see:** Same transaction appears twice
- **Diagnosis:** Bank feed downloaded same transaction twice
- **Fix:** Exclude the duplicate in the Banking feed (don't delete)

## 2025-Specifics
- Improved reconciliation interface with better transaction matching suggestions
- Enhanced filtering options during reconciliation
- Better mobile experience for reconciling on tablets
- Improved reconciliation report formatting
