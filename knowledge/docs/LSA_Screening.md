# 📘 FOUNDATION
**Screening Overview**: To run Local Services Ads (LSA), businesses must pass Google's screening process. This includes background checks, license verification, and insurance checks.

**Google Verified Badge (Blue)**:
- **Status**: Replacing the "Google Guarantee" (Green Check) in some contexts/experiments.
- **Definition**: A blue badge indicating the business has passed Google's extensive screening and verification process.
- **Requirement**: "Select users in the US will be required to undergo a risk-based verification process... eligible for accelerated verification, allowing them to get the Google Verified badge quickly."

**Key Requirements**:
- **Background Checks**: Identity and criminal history checks for business owners and field workers (via partners like Pinkerton). **No credit checks involved.**
- **Licenses**: State/Province level business and owner licenses required.
- **Insurance**: General liability insurance is mandatory.
- **Reviews**: Minimum review count (usually 1-5) required to go live.
- **Google Business Profile**: Must be verified and linked.

# 🛠️ WORKFLOW

### Phase 1: Document Prep
1. **Business License**: Ensure it's active and matches your business name exactly.
2. **Insurance**: Proof of General Liability Insurance.
3. **Owner ID**: Government-issued ID for the business owner.

### Phase 2: Submission
1. **LSA Dashboard**: Log in and navigate to the "Business Verification" section.
2. **Upload**: Submit documents for each required category (License, Insurance).
3. **Background Check**: Initiate the check via the dashboard link (often handled by Pinkerton). Field workers must also complete this if applicable.

### Phase 3: The "Blue Badge" Acceleration
1. **Eligibility**: Check if you are eligible for "Accelerated Verification".
2. **Action**: If eligible, you get the badge quickly but have **14 days** to complete remaining steps.
3. **Failure**: Missing the 14-day window results in ad pause or badge loss.

# 🛑 TRAP-DOORS (Verification Failures)

- **The 14-Day Timer**: For "Accelerated Verification", failing to complete full verification within 14 days leads to ad suspension.
- **Name Mismatch**: Business name on Insurance/License MUST match the LSA profile exactly.
- **Field Worker Gaps**: Failing to background check *all* field workers can cause account suspension.
- **"Risk-Based" Re-evaluation**: Google re-evaluates businesses regularly. A change in risk signals can trigger a sudden re-verification request.

# 🔧 TRIAGE MATRIX

| Issue | Diagnosis | Fix |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Background Check Stuck** | Vendor Delay | Contact Pinkerton directly (`pes.disputes@pinkerton.com`). |
| **License Rejected** | Name/Expiry | Check for exact name match or expired dates. Re-upload valid doc. |
| **Ads Paused (Verification)** | Incomplete Steps | Check dashboard for "Pending" items. Likely the 14-day window expired. |
| **Badge Missing** | Re-evaluation | You might be under a periodic risk assessment. Complete requested reviews immediately. |
