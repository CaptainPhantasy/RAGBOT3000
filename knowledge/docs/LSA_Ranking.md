# 📘 FOUNDATION
**Ranking Factors**: LSA uses a dynamic auction system combined with quality signals to determine ad position.
**Key Signals**:
- **Verification Status**: Google Verified Badge (Blue) / Google Guarantee (Green) is a prerequisite.
- **Responsiveness**: Speed of answering calls and replying to messages.
- **Reviews**: Star rating (3.0 minimum to appear) and volume (number of reviews).
- **Proximity**: Distance from the searcher (though service area settings matter more).
- **Bid**: "Maximize Leads" (Automated) vs. "Max Per Lead" (Manual bidding).

**Responsiveness Calculation**:
- **Business Hours**: Average response time is calculated during your set business hours over the last 90 days.
- **Weighted Average**: Recent leads carry more weight.
- **Missed Calls**: Heavily penalize your responsiveness score.

# 🛠️ WORKFLOW

### Phase 1: Optimization
1. **Get Reviews**: Aim for 5+ reviews immediately to stabilize ranking. Use the specific review URL provided in the dashboard.
2. **Set Hours**: Align ad schedule with *actual* phone coverage. Do not run ads when no one can answer.
3. **Enable Message Leads**: Turn on messaging to catch customers who prefer text, but *reply instantly*.

### Phase 2: Bidding Strategy
1. **Maximize Leads**: Default setting. Google adjusts bids to get the most leads for your budget. Good for starting.
2. **Target CPA**: If lead costs are too high, switch to manual bidding to cap the cost per lead.
3. **Budget**: Ensure your weekly budget is sufficient to cover at least 10 leads to gain traction.

### Phase 3: Reputation Management
1. **Request Reviews**: After every job, send the review link.
2. **Reply to Reviews**: Shows activity and engagement.
3. **Dispute Bad Reviews**: Only if they violate policy (e.g., not a customer, spam).

# 🛑 TRAP-DOORS (Ranking Killers)

- **Missed Calls**: The #1 killer of LSA ranking. If you miss calls, Google stops showing your ad.
- **Low Review Score**: Dropping below 3.0 stars removes your ad from the top results.
- **Inconsistent NAP**: Name/Address/Phone mismatch between LSA and GBP can hurt trust signals.
- **ignoring Leads**: Failing to mark leads as "Booked", "Archived", or "Replied" in the dashboard signals inactivity.
