# Getting Started with Workspaces

To create a new workspace in OrbitWork, navigate to the sidebar and click the "+" icon next to "My Spaces".
You must select a plan (Free, Team, or Enterprise) immediately.

*Note: Free plans are limited to 5 members.*

If you cannot see the "+" icon, check if you are a Guest user. Guests cannot create workspaces.
