## Why This Matters (Accounting Context)
Bills create:
- **Accounts Payable**: Money you owe suppliers
- **Expense recognition**: When incurred, not when paid
- **Cash flow management**: Track payment timing

Paying bills properly:
- Reduces Accounts Payable
- Updates bank balance
- Tracks payment methods and dates

## Common Error States / Pitfalls

### Using Expense instead of Bill
- **What you see:** No Accounts Payable created; Expense shows immediately on P&L
- **Diagnosis:** Used Expense form instead of Bill
- **Fix:**
  1. Delete the expense
  2. Re-enter as bill
  3. Or if paid, use Expense form correctly

### Duplicate bill payments
- **What you see:** Bill shows as paid twice; Negative Accounts Payable
- **Diagnosis:** Paid bill twice (manually + bank feed)
- **Fix:**
  1. Find duplicate payment
  2. Delete it
  3. If needed, re-enter correctly

### Wrong payment date
- **What you see:** Payment applied to wrong period
- **Diagnosis:** Future or past date entered
- **Fix:**
  1. Open bill payment
  2. Change payment date
  3. Save changes

## 2025-Specifics
- Enhanced bill matching with bank feeds
- Improved bill payment workflow
- Better vendor management features
