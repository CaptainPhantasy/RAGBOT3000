# 📘 FOUNDATION
**Suspension Definition**: Removal of a Business Profile from Google Search and Google Maps due to policy violations.
**Types**:
- **Soft Suspension**: Business is "disabled" or "pending" but you can still access the dashboard.
- **Hard Suspension**: Profile is removed entirely or "Cannot Appeal" status is shown.

**Common Triggers**:
- **Keyword Stuffing**: Adding non-official keywords to the business name (e.g., "Plumber in New York").
- **Virtual Offices**: Listing a UPS Store, Regus, or P.O. Box as a physical address.
- **Inconsistent Signage**: Street View or uploaded photos do not match the business name.
- **Online-Only**: Listing a business that does not meet customers face-to-face (unless hidden address SAB).
- **Duplicate Listings**: Creating multiple profiles for the same business/location.

# 🛠️ WORKFLOW

### Phase 1: Assessment
1. **Login**: Go to the Google Business Profile dashboard.
2. **Identify**: Look for the "Suspended" or "Disabled" notification.
3. **Review**: Check the email from Google for the specific policy violation (e.g., "Deceptive Content", "Quality Issues").

### Phase 2: Correction
1. **Fix the Data**:
   - Remove keywords from the business name.
   - Fix the address to a real physical location (or hide it for SABs).
   - Ensure hours match your website.
   - Delete duplicate listings.
2. **Gather Evidence**: Prepare **before** starting the appeal.
   - Business License / Registration.
   - Utility Bill (matching name/address).
   - Tax Certificate.
   - Photos of permanent signage.

### Phase 3: The Appeal
1. **Access Tool**: Go to the Google Business Profile Appeal Tool.
2. **Select Profile**: Choose the suspended business.
3. **Confirm Status**: Ensure it says "Eligible for Appeal".
4. **Submit**: Click Appeal.
5. **UPLOAD EVIDENCE**: **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**.

# 🛑 TRAP-DOORS (Critical Policy Risks)

> **THE 60-MINUTE TIMER**: "You have **60 minutes** from clicking 'Submit' to upload documents proving your business's legitimacy."
> **Failure to upload within this window can lead to automatic rejection.**

- **"Cannot Appeal" Status**: If the tool shows this, the decision is final, usually due to repeated severe violations.
- **New Account Creation**: "Attempting to create a new account after being suspended... [may result in] new accounts getting automatically suspended." Do not try to evade suspension; fix the original.
- **Editing During Appeal**: Do not make further edits after submitting the appeal until you hear back.

# 🔧 TRIAGE MATRIX

| Status / Error | Diagnosis | Fix |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"Eligible for Appeal"** | Standard suspension | Proceed with the Appeal Tool. Have documents ready. |
| **"Cannot Appeal"** | Permanent ban | No further action possible through standard tools. Check for severe violations (spam, fraud). |
| **Appeal Denied** | Insufficient proof | You may request an **Additional Review** if the original appeal was denied. Submit new, stronger evidence. |
| **"Quality Issues"** | General violation | Usually refers to Name, Address, or Business Model violations. Audit profile against Guidelines meticulously. |
| **No Response (3+ weeks)** | Backlog | Check status in the Appeal Tool. Do not submit duplicate requests. |
