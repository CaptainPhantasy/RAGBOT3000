# 📘 FOUNDATION
**Policy Goal**: To ensure a safe, consistent, and useful experience for users calling businesses from ads.

**Core Rules**:
-   **Verification**: Phone numbers must be verified as belonging to the business.
-   **Unacceptable Numbers**:
    -   **Premium Numbers**: Numbers that charge users extra (e.g., "900" numbers) are banned.
    -   **Personal/Private**: Numbers must be business lines.
    -   **Fax**: Not allowed.
-   **Display**: Numbers in ad text (Headline/Description) are generally disallowed. You must use "Call Assets" (formerly Call Extensions) or "Call Ads".

**Verification Methods**:
-   **Website Match**: The number in the ad must appear on the verified website.
-   **Domain Ownership**: Proof of domain ownership may be required.
-   **GMB Link**: Linking a verified Google Business Profile automatically verifies the number.

# 🛠️ WORKFLOW

### Phase 1: Adding a Number
1.  **Asset Creation**: Create a "Call Asset".
2.  **Input**: Enter the country and phone number.
3.  **Verification**: Google crawls your Final URL (landing page) to find the number.

### Phase 2: Troubleshooting "Unverified"
1.  **Check Website**: Does the number appear *textually* on the landing page? (Images don't count).
2.  **Link GMB**: Link your Google Business Profile to the Ads account. This trumps website crawling.
3.  **Documents**: If crawling fails, upload documents (phone bill) via the policy appeal tool.

# 🛑 TRAP-DOORS (Disapprovals)

-   **"Unverified Phone Number"**: Most common error. Occurs if the number isn't found on the landing page text.
-   **Text-in-Image**: Putting the phone number in an image on the website prevents Google from verifying it.
-   **Vanity Numbers**: "1-800-FLOWERS" might be flagged if the numeric equivalent isn't clear or verified.
-   **Redirects**: Numbers that redirect to a different business or affiliate line are prohibited.
-   **Voicemail Only**: Numbers that never answer or go straight to full voicemail may be flagged for "low quality".
