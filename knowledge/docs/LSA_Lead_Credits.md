# 📘 FOUNDATION
**Lead Credits**: Reimbursement for "poor quality" leads.
**Automated Logic (New for 2025)**:
- **Machine Learning**: Google's AI assesses leads *at initial contact*.
- **Invalid Leads**: Leads determined to be invalid/low quality are *not charged* initially.
- **Re-assessment**: Charged leads are re-evaluated over time. If the AI later decides it was poor quality, a credit is issued *automatically* (usually within 30 days).
- **Manual Dispute Removal**: Google is moving away from manual disputes for many categories, relying on this automated system.

**Valid vs. Invalid Leads**:
- **Valid (Charged)**: Customer inquiries about your service in your area.
- **Invalid (Credited)**: Spam, solicitors, wrong number, automated bot calls.
- **NOT Credited anymore**: "Job type not serviced" or "Geo not serviced" if your settings were broad. (You must refine settings instead).

# 🛠️ WORKFLOW

### Phase 1: Prevention (Settings)
1. **Refine Service Areas**: specific zip codes/cities.
2. **Refine Job Types**: Toggle off services you don't want.
3. **Hours**: Ensure ad schedule matches your actual availability to avoid "missed call" leads which affect ranking.

### Phase 2: Monitoring Automated Credits
1. **Check Lead Report**: Look for "Not charged" or "Credited" status.
2. **Wait 30 Days**: The AI re-assessment cycle can take up to a month.
3. **Feedback**: Rate every lead. Use the "Rate this lead" feature to train the model. This is *crucial* for the AI to learn what you consider "poor quality".

### Phase 3: Manual Dispute (If Available)
*Note: Availability is shrinking.*
1. **Identify**: Find the bad lead in the dashboard.
2. **Dispute**: If the option exists, select "Dispute" and choose the reason.
3. **Reason**: Must be objective (e.g., "Solicitor", "Bot", "Wrong Number"). Subjective reasons ("Price too high") are rejected.

# 🛑 TRAP-DOORS (Credit Denial)

- **"Job Type Not Serviced"**: You are no longer credited for this. You *must* update your profile settings to stop receiving them.
- **"Geo Not Serviced"**: Similarly, no credit. Update your service area.
- **The 24-Hour Gap**: You might see poor leads charged in the first 24 hours while the AI processes. These often get auto-credited later.
- **Healthcare/Tax Exclusion**: Lead credits are **NOT available** for health care verticals or tax specialists.

# 🔧 TRIAGE MATRIX

| Issue | Diagnosis | Fix |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Charged for Spam** | AI Missed It | Rate the lead as "Poor Quality" to trigger re-assessment. Wait 30 days. |
| **Charged for Wrong Service** | User Error | Update "Job Types" in profile. No credit available. |
| **No Credit Received (>30 days)** | Valid Lead | Google deems it a valid inquiry. Review lead recording. |
| **Dispute Option Missing** | Automation Shift | Your vertical/region has moved to fully automated credits. Rely on "Rating" leads. |
