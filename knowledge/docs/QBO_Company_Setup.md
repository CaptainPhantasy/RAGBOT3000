## Why This Matters (Accounting Context)
Setting up your company correctly ensures that QuickBooks categorizes transactions appropriately from day one. The industry selection determines your chart of accounts template, while business structure affects tax reporting. Getting this foundation right prevents costly rework later.

## Common Error States / Pitfalls

### Wrong business type selected
- **What you see:** Incorrect default accounts and tax settings
- **Diagnosis:** Review your Chart of Accounts after setup
- **Fix:** Go to Gear icon → Account and Settings → Company to update business type and industry

### Incorrect start date
- **What you see:** Missing transactions from before your QuickBooks start date
- **Diagnosis:** Compare financial records to QuickBooks reports
- **Fix:** You may need to import historical transactions or enter opening balances

## 2025-Specifics
- The 2025 setup wizard includes enhanced industry templates with more detailed default accounts
- Improved integration suggestions for popular business apps during setup
- Enhanced privacy mode toggle available during initial setup
