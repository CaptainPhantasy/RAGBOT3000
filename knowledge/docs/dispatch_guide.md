## Capacity Planning

### Understanding Capacity

**Capacity Concepts:**

**Available Hours:**
- Total work hours per technician per day
- Example: 8-hour day = 8 hours capacity

**Booked Hours:**
- Hours currently scheduled with jobs
- Includes job duration and drive time

**Utilization:**
- Percentage of available hours filled
- Example: 6 hours booked / 8 hours available = 75% utilization

**Open Capacity:**
- Remaining hours available for booking
- Example: 8 hours - 6 booked = 2 hours open

### Capacity Planning Methods

ServiceTitan offers multiple capacity planning approaches:

#### 1. Adaptive Capacity (Recommended - Modern)

**How It Works:**
- AI-powered capacity recommendations
- Automatically adjusts based on actual job durations
- Learns from historical data
- Suggests optimal booking amounts

**Benefits:**
- Most accurate capacity planning
- Reduces overbooking and underbooking
- Continuous improvement over time
- Less manual management

#### 2. Adjustable Capacity Planning (ACP)

**How It Works:**
- Set capacity limits per technician per day
- Define job duration estimates
- System calculates available slots
- Manually adjust as needed

**Settings:**
- Daily hours per technician
- Job type average durations
- Buffer time between jobs
- Drive time estimates

#### 3. Legacy Open Capacity Planning

**How It Works:**
- Simple hour-based capacity
- Set technician availability
- Book until capacity filled
- Basic calculations

**Use Cases:**
- Companies new to capacity planning
- Simpler scheduling needs
- Transitioning to advanced methods

### Using Capacity for Scheduling

#### Checking Capacity Before Booking

1. **View Dispatch Board**
   - See capacity indicators for each technician
   - Green = has capacity
   - Yellow = near capacity
   - Red = at/over capacity

2. **Check Specific Technician**
   - Click technician name
   - View available hours
   - See open time slots

3. **Book Job**
   - Assign to technician with capacity
   - System warns if overbooking
   - Override if necessary (emergencies, etc.)

#### Optimizing Capacity

**Goals:**
- High utilization (80-90% is typical target)
- Not overbooked (leads to overtime, rushed jobs)
- Balanced across team
- Customer time windows met

**Strategies:**
- Book high-demand times first (mornings, weekends)
- Fill gaps with flexible appointments
- Use "first available" for non-urgent jobs
- Adjust job durations based on actual performance
