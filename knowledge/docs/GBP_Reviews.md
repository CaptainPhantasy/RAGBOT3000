# 📘 FOUNDATION
**Review Importance**: Customer reviews drive visibility and trust. Google filters reviews to prevent spam, which can sometimes lead to legitimate reviews being removed or delayed.

**Key Definitions**:
- **Missing Reviews**: Reviews that customers wrote but do not appear on the profile. Often caused by Google's spam filters (e.g., identical IP address, too many reviews in short time).
- **Inappropriate Reviews**: Reviews that violate content policy (Hate speech, Conflict of interest, Spam).
- **Review Extortion**: When a customer threatens a bad review to get a refund or benefit.

# 🛠️ WORKFLOW

### Phase 1: Managing Reviews
1. **Monitor**: Check the "Reviews" tab in your GBP dashboard regularly.
2. **Reply**: Respond to *all* reviews, positive or negative. Professionalism neutralizes bad feedback.

### Phase 2: Reporting Inappropriate Reviews
1. **Identify Violation**: Ensure the review actually violates a policy (e.g., it's not just a negative opinion, but contains hate speech or is from a competitor).
2. **Flag**:
   - Go to the Reviews tab.
   - Click the three dots next to the review.
   - Select "Report review".
   - Choose the violation type.
3. **Wait**: Review decisions can take several days.

### Phase 3: Handling Missing Reviews
1. **Wait**: Reviews can be delayed by 2-7 days during high volume.
2. **Check for Spam Triggers**: Did the customer use the store WiFi? Did they send a link? These often trigger filters.
3. **Raise a Case**: If a review is missing for >7 days, contact Google Support with the reviewer's name and details.

# 🛑 TRAP-DOORS (Policy Risks)

- **Review Gating**: Do not "pre-screen" customers to only ask happy ones for reviews. This is a violation.
- **Incentivized Reviews**: Do not offer money, discounts, or gifts in exchange for reviews.
- **Self-Reviews**: Do not review your own business or have employees do it.
- **Review Extortion**: If a customer threatens a bad review, *do not give in*. Flag the review if it appears and report the user for extortion if possible.
