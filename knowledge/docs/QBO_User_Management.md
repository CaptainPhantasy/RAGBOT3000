## Common Error States / Pitfalls

### Too many admin users
- **What you see:** Multiple users with full access
- **Risk:** Errors harder to track
- **Fix:**
  1. Review user permissions quarterly
  2. Limit admin access to essential users

### Insufficient permissions
- **What you see:** User can't perform needed tasks
- **Diagnosis:** Access rights too restrictive
- **Fix:**
  1. Edit user permissions
  2. Add necessary access

### Former employees still have access
- **What you see:** Departed user can still log in
- **Risk:** Security vulnerability
- **Fix:**
  1. Immediately deactivate user
  2. Consider what to do with their transactions

## 2025-Specifics
- Enhanced user role customization
- Improved user management interface
- Better access control granularity
