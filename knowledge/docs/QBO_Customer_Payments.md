# QuickBooks Customer Payments

## Visual UI Anchors
- **+ New** → **Receive payment**
- **Sales** → **Customers** → Select customer → **Receive payment**
- **Receive Payment form**: Customer dropdown, Outstanding invoices list
- **Deposit to**: Undeposited Funds or specific bank account
- **Email receipt** checkbox

## Step-by-Step Workflow (2025)
1. Click **+ New** → **Receive payment**
2. Select **Customer** from dropdown
3. **Verify payment amount** (auto-fills from invoice balances)
4. Check off invoices being paid:
   - Can be full or partial payment
   - QuickBooks applies payment automatically
5. Enter **Payment date**
6. Select **Payment method** (Cash, Check, Credit card, etc.)
7. Enter **Reference number** (check number, etc.)
8. Ensure **Deposit to** is **Undeposited Funds** (not bank account)
9. Click **Save and close** or **Save and new**

## Why This Matters (Accounting Context)
Receiving payments correctly:
- Reduces Accounts Receivable
- Updates invoice status
- Tracks payment methods
- Groups payments for proper bank deposits

Using **Undeposited Funds** ensures your bank register matches actual bank deposits.

## Common Error States / Pitfalls

### Depositing directly to bank account
- **What you see:** Individual payments show in bank register; Bank register doesn't match bank statements
- **Diagnosis:** Deposit to field set to bank account instead of Undeposited Funds
- **Fix:**
  1. Delete incorrect payment
  2. Re-receive with Undeposited Funds
  3. Create proper deposit later

### Not matching to correct invoice
- **What you see:** Invoice still shows unpaid; Customer balance incorrect
- **Diagnosis:** Payment not applied to invoice
- **Fix:**
  1. Open the payment
  2. Ensure correct invoice is checked
  3. Save changes

### Overpayment handling
- **What you see:** Customer paid more than invoice amount
- **Diagnosis:** Payment exceeds invoice total
- **Fix:**
  1. Receive full payment
  2. Create credit for excess amount
  3. Apply to future invoice or refund

## 2025-Specifics
- Enhanced payment matching with improved auto-detection
- Better handling of multiple invoice payments
- Improved integration with online payment processors
- Enhanced mobile payment recording
