# API Key Configuration

API Keys are located under Settings > Developer > Tokens.

1. Click "Generate New Token".
2. Assign scopes (Read-only or Read-Write).
3. Copy the token immediately. It is never shown again.

*Warning: If you lose your token, you must regenerate it, breaking existing integrations.*
