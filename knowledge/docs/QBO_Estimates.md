# QuickBooks Estimates

## Visual UI Anchors
- **+ New** → **Estimate**
- **Sales** → **Estimates** tab
- **Estimate form**: Similar to invoice but marked as "Estimate"
- **Status field**: Pending, Accepted, Closed, Rejected
- **Create invoice button**: Convert estimate to invoice

## Step-by-Step Workflow (2025)
1. Click **+ New** → **Estimate**
2. Select **Customer** from dropdown
3. Enter **Estimate date** and **Expiration date** (if applicable)
4. Add **Products/Services**:
   - Select items and quantities
   - Enter rates (should auto-fill from item setup)
5. Add customer **Message** (optional)
6. Click **Save and send** or **Save and close**
7. To convert to invoice:

## Why This Matters (Accounting Context)
Estimates:
- Provide quotes to customers
- Don't create financial transactions (non-posting)
- Can be converted to invoices for billing
- Help track potential revenue

Converting estimates saves time and ensures billing accuracy.
