Meet **RAGBOT3000** — the AI teammate that actually *knows its stuff*. No BS. No hallucinations. No "I think maybe possibly..." nonsense. Just real help, grounded in real documentation.

Think of it as the coworker who actually read the manual. Wild, right?

## What Makes This Bot Special?

### 🎯 **It Actually Does Things (Revolutionary, We Know)**

Most AI chatbots: "Here's a 47-step essay about the philosophy of clicking a button."

RAGBOT3000: "Click here. Good? Cool, moving on."

- ✅ Turns boring docs into **actual steps you can follow**
- ✅ Explains stuff when you're confused, skips it when you're not
- ✅ **Checks your work** like a good lab partner
- ✅ When stuff breaks, it goes full detective mode

### 🎤 **Talk to It Like a Human (Wild Concept)**

Why type when you can just... talk?

- **Real-time voice** — it actually listens and responds (shocking)
- **Interrupt anytime** — tell it to shut up mid-sentence (we won't tell)
- **Multilingual** — speak Spanish, French, German, or whatever. It gets it. No translation app needed.
- **Pretty sparkles** — because why not? ✨
- **Works on your phone** — fullscreen, no browser clutter

### 👁️ **It Can Actually See What You're Doing**

Stop explaining in broken English. Just show it.

- **Screen sharing** — "See that thing? Why is it broken?" Problem solved. *(Desktop/Android only — Apple said no)*
- **Camera feed** — point your phone at stuff in the real world
- **Flip camera** — front or back, your choice. Show your face or show the problem.
- **Live preview** — see what it sees (no, it's not judging you)

### 🧠 **It Remembers... Briefly**

RAGBOT3000 has short-term memory. Like a goldfish, but useful.

- **Picks up where you left off** — interrupted? It remembers.
- **Forgets in 72 hours** — because privacy > creepy data hoarding
- **Doesn't judge** — your workflow is safe with us

### 🎨 **One Bot, Many Personalities**

Swap its brain like changing a cartridge.

- **Swap expertise** — Notion guru today, Stripe wizard tomorrow
- **Rebrand it** — change the name, voice, vibes, whatever
- **Works anywhere** — feed it any docs, it adapts
- **Speaks your language** — literally. Multilingual support means global teams can use it without awkward Google Translate moments.

## How Does This Thing Work?

1. You tell it what you're trying to do
2. It reads the actual documentation (what a concept)
3. It guides you step-by-step
4. You verify each step so you know you're not lost
5. When you hit a wall, it troubleshoots

No making stuff up. No "As an AI language model..." speeches. Just help.

### On Your Phone (Yeah, It Works on Mobile)

2. Tap **Share** → **Add to Home Screen**
3. Boom. It's an app now. Fullscreen. No browser bar.
4. Tap **VOICE** or **LIVE** to start *(SCREEN works on Android, but iOS said "nah")*

5. Start talking. Or just click stuff. Whatever.

## What It's Actually Good At

- **Learning new platforms** — "How do I even start with X?" → Done.
- **Fixing broken stuff** — "Why is this error haunting me?" → Fixed.
- **Complex workflows** — "Walk me through this 47-step process" → Walked.
- **Understanding concepts** — "What even is Z?" → Explained, no Wikipedia essay.

---

## What It's NOT

- ❌ **A know-it-all** — if it doesn't know, it admits it (refreshing, right?)
- ❌ **A data vacuum** — your stuff expires in 72 hours
- ❌ **A hallucination machine** — grounds everything in actual docs
- ❌ **Sentient** — yet 👀

## The Nerdy Bits (Skip If You Don't Care)

Built with:
- **Google Gemini** — because it actually works
- **React + TypeScript** — for people who like their code to not break
- **Progressive Web App** — fancy words for "installs like an app"
- **Real-time audio streaming** — sub-second latency (fast = good)
- **Keyword RAG** — no vector database, just fast grep-style search

## Make It Your Own

Want to teach it about *your* platform?

1. Dump your docs in `/knowledge/docs/` (markdown files)
2. Register them in `/knowledge/index.json`
3. Tweak the personality in `/persona/` (name, voice, sass level)
4. Deploy it. Congrats, you have a custom AI expert.

### Fun Facts Nobody Asked For

- The sparkles are just vibing. They don't do anything. We kept them because they're pretty.
- It can interrupt itself if you start talking. Polite.
- The name "RAGBOT3000" implies there were 2,999 earlier versions. There weren't. It just sounds cooler.
- Yes, it works on iOS. Yes, we tested it. Yes, it was painful.
- Screen sharing doesn't work on iOS because Apple's WebKit doesn't support it. We don't make the rules.
- The camera flip button exists because showing your face when you meant to show your broken printer is embarrassing.
- It's multilingual because the world doesn't all speak English (shocking, we know). Speak to it in your language, it'll respond in kind.
